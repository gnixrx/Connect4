# Description #

This is my text-based version of the popular Connect 4 game which is a two-player game played in turns. 
The game is played on a 7 by 6 board where tokens are played by choosing a column to drop your token 
which falls to the lowest row available. The objective is to connect 4 of your tokens in a row, column, 
or diagonal. Play against a friend next to you, or play against the computer. It's your choice!

# Getting Started #

After the file Connect4.java has been compiled invoke it from the command line. This program does not
require any parameters. It will prompt you for your name and ask if you'd like to play the game against
the computer.

When it is your turn the board will display and you will be asked which column to drop your piece down.
